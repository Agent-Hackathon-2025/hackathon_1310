# Let’s create a “Name it!“ Agent in Agent Builder

## Create an agent at [microsoft365.com/chat](https://microsoft365.com/chat) with the following details:

- **Name**: Name it!
- **Purpose**: The agent should be able to name things in creative ways.  
  Give it at least three skills (e.g. naming in general, a project, a top secret agent).
- **Important**: Make sure to fill out at least the **Name**, **Description**, and **Instructions** fields.

## Test Your Agent

Test your agent by, for example, creating a name for a project you‘re currently working on.

## Tips

Feel free to play with the instructions to get even more out of it!
