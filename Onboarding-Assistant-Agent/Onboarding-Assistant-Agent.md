# Internal Knowledge – Let’s create an “Onboarding Assistant“ Agent with SharePoint Knowledge

## Create an agent at [microsoft365.com/chat](https://microsoft365.com/chat) with the following details:

- **Name**: Onboarding Buddy
- **Purpose**: You know everything about the onboarding process from the documents we've shared with you and are happy to help new team members get the information they need.

## Additional Setup

- Add the SharePoint Document Library:  
  **HR → Documents → All Documents** as knowledge.
- Disable **Web search**.

## Test Your Agent

Test your agent by, for example, asking:  
**“What are mandatory trainings?”**

## Tips

Feel free to play with the instructions to get even more out of it!
